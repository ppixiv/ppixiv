# The signatures database holds ImageSignatures for images we've computed a
# signature for.
#
# This could be a field in FileIndex, but there are advantages to having it in
# a separate database:
#
# - We store this for every file we thumbnail.  The main cost of doing this is
# decoding the image in the first place, so it's cheapest to just do it when we
# already have the image decoded.  This happens whether the image is bookmarked
# or not, so putting it in a separate db avoids bloating the main file index with
# every image that's been viewed.
# - It's convenient to be able to wipe the main database and recreate it, but it
# would be a pain to lose all computed signatures too, since recomputing those takes
# much longer than populating the index.
#
# Our IDs are the ones we load into ImageIndex.
#
# We don't share IDs with file_index, and there's no foreign key relationship since
# we're in a separate database.  We just use the path to match them up.
