    Convert an image to one that browsers can read, to allow viewing images like TIFFs.

    This is a little tricky.  We don't want to spend too much time compressing the image,
    since we're sending to a browser on the same machine, and the browser is just going
    to spend more time decompressing it.

    We could send it completely uncompressed.  If we do that, we'd want to tell the browser
    to not cache (or set a short cache period), so it doesn't waste space caching uncompressed
    images.  However, there's no good browser format for uncompressed RGBA images.
    
    PNG has no uncompressed mode and is still pretty slow with a 0 compression level.
    RGBA BMPs aren't really supported anywhere.

    Lossless WebP is slow, even if it's set to the fastest compression level.  This is a
    design mistake: the fastest lossless method should just be passing through uncompressed
    data, so you can use the decoder support with zero compression overhead.

    Instead, we use lossy WebP on a fast method.  It's about twice as fast as lossless WebP
    in its fastest mode and 20% faster than PNG in compress_level=0.

    For RGB images, we just use JPEG.  It's 10x faster than WebP.
