# This implements indexing for file searching.
#
# Keyword searches use Windows's file indexing.  It avoids duplicating the
# indexing work and keeps what we're doing lightweight.
# 
# Files are cached in our database.  During initial scanning we search for
# bookmarked files by looking for our metadata files, and cache the files.
# These cache entries are unpopulated: they only have the data we can get from
# the file entry, plus any bookmarking data.  This allows us to do searches
# for bookmarked files, which Windows's search won't do, but we don't spend
# a lot of time reading files if the user has thousands of bookmarks.
#
# An unpopulated entry is a placeholder, created by _get_placeholder_entry.
# This can be stored in the database, or it can be created as a temporary
# entry from a Windows search result.  We populate entries as we return them,
# so if we're returning the first 50 results of 1000, we only spend time reading
# the 50 files we're returning.  The populated data is then cached in the database,
# replacing any unpopulated entry, so we only have to do this once per file.
#
# We don't proactively remove entries from the database if they're deleted from
# disk.  We only delete them if a search sees them and finds that the file no
# longer exists.  This usually happens when _get_entry checks the mtime of the file.
#
# A limitation of this is that we can't search on file metadata that we can't get
# from Windows search.
#
# Paths are stored in the database as strings, and entries internally stay that
# way.  We only convert paths to BasePath in public APIs (see _convert_to_path).
#
# XXX: how can we detect if indexing is enabled on our directory
# XXX: we shouldn't do a full refresh on changes, but not sure how to find out if
# indexing is up to date for a path in order to use quick refresh
